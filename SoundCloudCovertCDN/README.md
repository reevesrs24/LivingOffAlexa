Using SoundCloud as a Covert CDN

This project utilizes the SoundCloud infrastructure as a covert CDN.  An executable file is embedded into a wav file which only causes minor pertubations to the original music.  The file is then uploaded to SoundCloud where rea teams can store beacon files in a covert manner.  Utilizing legitimate domains makes it more difficult for IOC's to be developed and mitigates the change that these domains will be added to a blocklist.
